In this project, the business is a retail company that sells different consumer packaged goods (CPG) products. The data, which is in Excel format, contains sales information on different items. 

Different reports in the forms of Pivot Table and Dashboard are created to summarize sales information of these CPG products.

The goal is to create reports that sale managers at the retail company can use to identify popularity and sales trends of CPG products that the retail sells
